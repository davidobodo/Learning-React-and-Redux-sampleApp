				<p>this is the home page for this funny app that i am creating right now Dear friend, you need to understand when people are good for friendship and when they are good for a relationship. Most times we just go on and ruin a very good friendship because we are leaning on our emotions. God plants people in your life to help you and comfort you for a season and with a reason , but we always go and mess things up by dating the people He has put in our path to help us get to where He is taking us.</p>
